# CrowdStrike

This repo contains everything needed to replicate a paper submitted to *Management Science* on the consequences of the CrowdStrike bug release. To replicate this project, all that needs to be done is to run the crowdstrike.R script. By simply running this script, any missing dependencies will be installed for the user.
